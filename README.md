# Conatus MCP Server

An independently installable [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for the self-hosted Conatus task manager.

It exposes agent-safe tools for projects, sections, tasks, labels, comments and reminders. It supports local `stdio` clients and remote Streamable HTTP clients. Permanent deletion is intentionally not exposed.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- A reachable Conatus installation with the `/api/v1` API
- A scoped API token created in **Settings → API tokens**

## Local stdio setup

The local mode is the recommended default. The AI host starts one MCP process for the configured task-manager account.

### One-command setup

Run the interactive installer to validate your Conatus URL and scoped API token, then register the server with Claude Desktop, Cursor, or another JSON MCP configuration file:

```bash
npx -y conatus-mcp setup
```

The installer never echoes the token, verifies it before changing a config file, and restricts the written configuration file to owner-only permissions where the operating system supports them. Restart the chosen client when it finishes. The direct configuration below remains the non-interactive fallback.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-tasks": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "conatus-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TASKS_BASE_URL": "https://tasks.example.com",
        "TASKS_API_TOKEN": "tdm_replace_me"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a local development installation, use `http://localhost:3000` as `TASKS_BASE_URL`.

You can also install the package once:

```bash
npm install --global conatus-mcp
conatus-mcp
```

## Remote Streamable HTTP mode with browser OAuth

Use OAuth when an agent needs to connect by URL. The MCP server acts as a single-user gateway: its scoped `TASKS_API_TOKEN` identifies the task workspace, while each AI client receives a separate short-lived OAuth token. The task token never leaves the server.

```bash
TASKS_BASE_URL=https://tasks.example.com \
TASKS_API_TOKEN=tdm_replace_me \
MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
MCP_PORT=3001 \
MCP_PUBLIC_URL=https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD='use-a-long-separate-approval-password' \
MCP_OAUTH_STORE_PATH=/var/lib/task-mcp/oauth-store.json \
MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-ai-host.example \
conatus-mcp-http
```

Give the AI client only `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`. A compatible client discovers the protected-resource metadata, dynamically registers itself, opens the approval page and completes an OAuth authorization-code flow with S256 PKCE. Enter `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` in that page to approve it.

The server issues one-hour access tokens and rotating 30-day refresh tokens. OAuth client registrations and token hashes are stored in the file at `MCP_OAUTH_STORE_PATH` with mode `0600`; raw OAuth tokens and the approval password are not stored. Run one MCP replica per store file. For multiple replicas, replace the JSON store with a shared transactional store first.

Put TLS and a reverse proxy in front of port 3001. `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` must be the exact external endpoint and end in `/mcp`. Production URLs must use HTTPS. Requests carrying an `Origin` header are accepted only when the origin is listed in `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; native clients commonly send no Origin.

### Domain and reverse proxy

The task app and MCP gateway can use separate addresses:

- `https://tasks.example.com` → the web app and `/api/v1`
- `https://mcp.example.com/mcp` → this child MCP service

Create DNS records for both names, terminate TLS at your proxy and forward `mcp.example.com` to port 3001. Only the proxy should expose that port. The OAuth metadata, registration, authorization, token, revocation, approval and MCP endpoints all share the MCP origin.

### Static bearer fallback

For clients that cannot perform OAuth, omit `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` and `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD`, then set `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` to a long random value. Connect to `/mcp` and send that value as a bearer token. This is less convenient to rotate per client and should not be pasted into prompts.

Binding to a non-loopback address without either complete OAuth configuration or `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` is rejected.

### Docker

Released images are published to `ghcr.io/nojusmorkunas/conatus-mcp`. Build locally only when working on the server itself:

```bash
docker build -t conatus-mcp .
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:3001:3001 \
  -v task-mcp-oauth:/data \
  -e TASKS_BASE_URL=https://tasks.example.com \
  -e TASKS_API_TOKEN=tdm_replace_me \
  -e MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e MCP_PUBLIC_URL=https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
  -e MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD='use-a-long-separate-approval-password' \
  -e MCP_OAUTH_STORE_PATH=/data/oauth-store.json \
  conatus-mcp
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TASKS_BASE_URL` | yes | none | Task-manager origin without `/api/v1` |
| `TASKS_API_TOKEN` | yes | none | `tdm_` scoped token or a legacy `tdc_` token |
| `TASKS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | `15000` | Upstream API timeout |
| `MCP_HOST` | HTTP only | `127.0.0.1` | HTTP bind address |
| `MCP_PORT` | HTTP only | `3001` | HTTP port |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | no | task-manager origin | Comma-separated browser origins |
| `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` | OAuth mode | none | Exact public HTTPS MCP URL ending in `/mcp` |
| `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` | OAuth mode | none | Separate 16+ byte password entered on the approval page |
| `MCP_OAUTH_STORE_PATH` | no | `./data/oauth-store.json` | Persistent OAuth registrations and token hashes |
| `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` | bearer mode | none | Static fallback credential clients use to access MCP |

Do not put tokens in prompts, tool arguments, source control or command-line arguments. Environment variables keep them out of MCP messages and most process listings.

To revoke one OAuth client, let that client call the advertised revocation endpoint. To revoke every connected client, stop the service and remove its OAuth store file, then restart; all clients must connect again. Revoke or rotate `TASKS_API_TOKEN` in task-manager Settings if the gateway itself is compromised.

## Tools

- Workspace: `get_workspace_context`
- Projects: `list_projects`, `get_project`, `create_project`, `update_project`
- Sections: `create_section`, `update_section`
- Tasks: `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `create_task`, `quick_add_task`, `update_task`, `move_task`, `complete_task`, `reopen_task`, `set_task_labels`
- Labels: `list_labels`, `create_label`
- Collaboration: `add_comment`
- Scheduling: `set_reminder`

Create operations use idempotency keys so retries do not create duplicate tasks. Task and comment content is returned as structured user data and must not be treated as agent instructions.

## Development

```bash

npm run build
npm run dev
```

Test the built stdio server with MCP Inspector:

```bash

TASKS_API_TOKEN=tdm_replace_me \
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/cli.js
```

## Releasing

Publishing a GitHub release builds `ghcr.io/nojusmorkunas/conatus-mcp` for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, then publishes the npm package. Both come from the released commit, so a release either produces both artifacts or neither.

Tag the release `vX.Y.Z` matching `package.json`; the npm job refuses to publish a mismatch. Mark prereleases as such on GitHub and they go to the `beta` dist-tag, leaving `latest` on the newest stable release.

npm publishing uses [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers), so this repository stores no npm token. It requires a one-time configuration on the package's npmjs.com settings page linking it to this repository and the `Publish release` workflow.

To publish by hand instead:

```bash
npm publish
```

`prepublishOnly` reruns the test, lint and build checks. `publishConfig.access` is already set, so no `--access` flag is needed.
